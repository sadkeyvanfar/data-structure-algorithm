 * The top K elements pattern is a technique that aims to return a given number of the most frequent/largest/smallest elements in a given set.
 *
 * The key data structure of solving the top K elements problems is heap. As the feature of max heap and min heap, we can always get the largest and smallest elements efficiently, i.e., O(logN).
