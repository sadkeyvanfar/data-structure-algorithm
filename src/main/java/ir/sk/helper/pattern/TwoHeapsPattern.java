 * In many problems, where we are given a set of elements such that we can divide them into two parts.
 * We are interested in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part.
 * As the name suggests, this technique uses a Min-Heap to find the smallest element and a Max-Heap to find the biggest element.
