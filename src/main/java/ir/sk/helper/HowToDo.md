#steps to solve the problem by canvas:
1. clarification: The Constraints area is where you fill in all constraints of the problem. This includes things like how large the input array can be, can the input string contain unicode characters, is the robot allowed to make diagonal moves in the maze, can the graph have negative edges, etc.
2. Ideas and Description generation: After you've identified all constraints, you go into idea generation. start from brute force one.
3. Complexity: time and space
4. implementation
