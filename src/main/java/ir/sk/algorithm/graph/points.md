Graph can be:
1. Directed or Undirected
2. weighted or Unweighted
3. Cyclic or Acyclic
4. Connected or Disconnected

Main Algorithms:
1. getNeighborsFor
2. dfs
3. bfs

Algorithms based on Main Algorithms:
1. Path Detection -> bfs (shortest path for unweighted), dfs
2. Cycle Detection (directed or undirected) -> dfs
3. Connected Components (directed or undirected) -> dfs
4. TwoColorGraph -> dfs
5. TopologicalSort -> dfs
6. SPT(Shortest Path Tree) (weighted graph) -> Topological sort, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford
7. MST(Minimum Spanning Tree) (weighted graph) -> Kruskal, Prime
