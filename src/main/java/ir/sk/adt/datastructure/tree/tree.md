# Data Structures: Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node, and every node can have zero or more child nodes. Trees are widely used in computer science for various applications, including representing hierarchical data, parsing expressions, and implementing search algorithms.

## Types of Binary Trees:
Full Binary Tree: A full binary tree is a binary tree where every node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
```
        A
      /   \
     B     C
    / \
   D   E
```
Complete Binary Tree: A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
```
        A
      /   \
     B     C
    / \   /
   D   E F
```
Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree is perfect binary Tree if all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
```
        A
      /   \
     B     C
    / \   / \
   D   E F   G
```

in Tree, in each level the size become double
