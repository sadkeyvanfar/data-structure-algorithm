remember, when you think about data structure vs adt, we just think about container not operations, ot all operations,
for example the main feature of array is random access so binary search and the main feature of linked list is easy add and delete an node so operations like first delete or last delete are good, or BST binary search and easy add and delete nodes.
GeneralTree is used for decision tree

Types of Binary Trees:
Full Binary Tree: A full binary tree is a binary tree where every node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree is perfect binary Tree if all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
Complete Binary Tree: A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
