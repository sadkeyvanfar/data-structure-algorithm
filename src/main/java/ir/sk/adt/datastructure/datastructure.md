# Points:
interviews are to see the power of person in problem solving .

data structures are used in problem solving.

data structures is a way to organize and mange data.

a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them and the operations the can be applied to the data.
Complexity is fundamental to understand data structures.

Remember, when you think about data structure vs adt, we just think about container not operations, or all operations,
for example the main feature of array is random access so binary search and the main feature of linked list is easy add and delete a node so operations like first delete or last delete are good, or BST binary search and easy add and delete nodes.
GeneralTree is used for decision tree

## Types of Binary Trees:
Full Binary Tree: A full binary tree is a binary tree where every node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
Complete Binary Tree: A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree is perfect binary Tree if all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

in Tree, in each level the size become double
